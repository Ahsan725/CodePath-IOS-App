# Prework - *Ahsan IOS App*

Submitted by: **Ahsan Baseer**

**Ahsan IOS App** is an app that displays a launch screen when launched. After that, it displays a screen with three labels with my name, the name of my college, and my dream job. It also displays a button that says 'change'. When clicked upon this button it changes the color of the background and the color of the first and third labels. All three colors are randomly generated based on the red, blue, and green values and opacity. I utilized different font sizes for each label and tested the app on different models of simulation. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Among my favorite apps are Discord, Instagram, and TikTok. Discord's feature of creating servers and managing them makes it a go-to platform for engaging with communities. Instagram's feature of reacting to stories, comments, etc with emojis is great and adds a creative element to my online experience. TikTok stands out with its interactive filters. 

I want to create a social media app where users can create their own servers and moderate them. Additionally, it will allow users to post stories and react to them using emojis. Additionally, they will also have the option of interactive filters and activities. 

Another option I was thinking of was a finance/budgeting app. This will enable users to create communities/servers of like-minded individuals like FIRE, leanFIRE, CoastFire, etc. They will have the option to engage in interactive activities to stay connected and get educated about their goals and be able to encourage each other on posts using various ways of communication including emojis, etc. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was an unfamiliar development environment and took a bit of getting used to. It included some drag and drop which I was unfamiliar with in the context of coding. The interface of XCODE requires a learning curve for someone coming from a VSCODE type of development environment.
