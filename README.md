# Prework - *Ahsan IOS App*

Submitted by: **Ahsan Baseer**

**Ahsan IOS App** is an app that displays a launch screen when launched. After that it displays a screen with three labels with my name, the name of my college and dream job. It also displays a button that says 'change'. When clicked upon this button it changes the color of the background as well as the color of the first label and the third label. All three colors are randomly generated based on the red, blue and green values and opacity. I utilized different font sizes for each label and tested the app on difefrent models of simulation. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was a unfamilair development environment and took a bit of getting used to. It included some drag and drop which I was unfamilar with in the context of coding. The intrerface of XCODE requires a learning curve for someone coming from VSCODE type of development environemnt.
